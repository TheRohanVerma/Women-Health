1.To track the menstrual cycle-
                #Inputting the menstrual cycle history-start date,end date,next date and some other information.

**TECHNOLOGY USED-**
1.Visual studio 2017 with C# for making the web pages 
2.Pycharm IDE for integrating the trained classifier to our web application using Flask.

**DATA/REPOSITORY'S USED**
1.templates picked from template.co website
2.https://github.com/leanderme/sytora- used this for getting the  multinomial Naive Bayes classifier which is trained on a handpicked dataset, which is freely available under CC4.0.
